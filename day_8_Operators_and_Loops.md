# Computer Logic and Loops
## Learning Objectives
Explain how computers work, using technical terminology, at more than one level of detail.
Implement for and while loops to accomplish meaningful tasks in code.
## Class Agenda
Discussion Reading
Read 08: Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators:  Evaluating Conditions
- == Is Equal to 
- ! = In Not Equal To
- === Strict Equal To
- !==Strict Not Equal To
- > Greater Than sign
- >= Greater Than or Equal To sign
- < Less Than sign
- <= Less Than or Equal To

Structuring Comparison Operators
       Enclosing Parentheses
        (score   >=   pass)
      operand   |     Operand
        comparison Operator

## Logical Operators
Do expression 1 and expression 2 both evaluate to true?

- && Logical and (This operator test more than one condition.)
- || Logical or (This operator tests at least one condition. )
- Logical Not (This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it. )

     Locical Operator

## Loops 

Keyword - Condition (counter)  - Opening Curly Brace
for (var i = 0; i <10; i++) {
    document.write(i);
  -Code to execute during loop-
}

- For
- While
- Do While

## Loop Counters

- var i = 0; (Initialization)
- i < 10; (Condition)
- i++ (Update) (i++ so it doesn't run forever)

## New Vocabulary
loop - 
while (loop)
for (loop)
condition
increment - increase by 1
decrement - decrease by 1

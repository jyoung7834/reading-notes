## Growth mindset is living in the world of possibilities!
- Learning from failures
- When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. 
- Rembering that nothing is easy at first
- I don't know how...**yet**!

### Mastering Markdown in Github

GitHub Flavored Markdown
GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

Note that some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the descriptions and comments of Issues and Pull Requests. These include @mentions as well as references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests. Task Lists are also available in Gist comments and in Gist Markdown files.

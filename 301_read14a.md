# Database Normalization

Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.

By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database.

## Reasons for Database Normalization
  * Minimize duplicate data
  * Minimize or avoid data modification issues
  * Simplify queries

## Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies

Duplicated information presents two problems:
  * It increases storage and decrease performance.
  * It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.


## Definition of Database Normalizaion

The process to redesign the table is database normalization.  The process to redesign the table is database normalization.

The forms are progressive, meaning that to qualify for 3rd normal form a table must first satisfy the rules for 2nd normal form, and 2nd normal form must adhere to those for 1st normal form. Before we discuss the various forms and rules in detail, let’s summarize the various forms:

- *First Normal Form* – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.

- *Second Normal Form* – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.

- *Third Normal Form* – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key

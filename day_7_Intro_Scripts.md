- Writing A Script
    - To writ a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. 
        - Define the goal
        - Design the Script
        - Code each step

## Summary 
- The ABC of Programming
- A:  What is a script and how do I create one?
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

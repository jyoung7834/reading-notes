# What Google Learned About Teams

I found that the article in The New Your Times Magazine - What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team to be very interesting and made a lot of sense, especially after working in groups in Remo and working for the same company for 13 years.  

I've always wondered why some groups were more successful than others and the 2012 initiative Google performed code-named Project Aristotle that came to the following conclusion:

    For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.  Also, psychological safety and emotional conversations were related. The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.

I can totally relate to this article because my current job I actually have an office persona (Jacqueline) and a home persona (Jacque).  Being in my current position working in the office with the CEO and the President is a pretty lonely place to be in.  You aren't close with your bosses for the obvious reasons and you can't really get close with other that aren't in Administration because they seem to always want "the scoop",  information you have that not all employees necessarily need to know.  The culture at my previous job at a casino in Reno, NV was more inclusive.  We had a team of people that were close on and off of the job.  We worked way more hours than I do at the bank but really enjoyed doing so.  I'm sure there is a difference between a job you need and a career you want.  

In conclusion this article was eye opening.

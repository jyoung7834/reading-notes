It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return. Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
Design is about communication.  Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.  You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.  You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

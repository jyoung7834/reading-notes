# COMPONENT BASED ARCHITECTURE

Component-based architecture focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties.  The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability. 

What is a component?  A component is an independent, reusable code block, which divides the UI into smaller pieces. [https://codeburst.io/react-js-understanding-functional-class-components-e65d723e909]

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities.  It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

What are the charactistics of a component?  

* Reusability - Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications.  However, some components may be designed for specific task. 
* Replacable - Components may be freely substituted with other similar components. 
* Not context specific - Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts. 
* Extensible - A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior. 
Encapsulated - A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state. 
* Independent - Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components. 

What are the advantages of using component based architecture?  

* Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.
* Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components. 


# WHAT IS PROPS AND HOW TO USE IT IN REACT

What is props short for?  Props is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.  Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components. 

How are props used in React? Props are a javascript object. When you need to get a value from the props object, you need to use the dot notation so you can get specific values which in the video is text.

{props.text}

What is the flow of props?
1)  Create a parentComponent file use .js or .jsx extension
2)  Import React and Component
3)  Define a class
4)  Create first child file and import React
5)  This component will return a <p> element. 
6)  Component will be called like an HTML tag, but starting with a cipital letter ie '<FirstChild />'

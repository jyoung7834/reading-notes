# The Call Stack defined on MDN

A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

In summary, then, we start with an empty Call Stack. Whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. Ultimately, the Stack is empty again.

# Understanding the javaScript Call Stack

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

**LIFO**: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

**Manage** function invocation (call): The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous.

**In summary**
The key takeaways from the call stack are:
1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.

 

# JavaScript error message

**Types of error messages**

*  Reference errors
*  Syntax errors
*  Range errors
*  Type errors

**Debugging**
To debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code (press cmd+o in macOS or Ctrl+o in Windows) and choose your file to debug, click the line you wanna debug and refresh your page again

* testing is automatically called since it’s an IIFE (immediately Invoked Function Expression);
* obj variable is declared with the function add (using ES6 shorthand for functions in objects, it would be the same having var obj = { add: add } ;
* the function add is called from the obj variable with two strings has parameters, there are added which makes them “12” in this scenario and then split is called before returning [“1”, “2”];
* the function add is called again, this time with number, the values are added making it 3 but then, split (which is not available for number type variables) is called which makes an error being thrown;

**Handling errors**
About the light blue part of our earliest example of an error message, that shows up like that when we do not handle errors properly, meaning that anything after that error will not be executed. To avoid this we usually try to catch the errors so we can gracefully fallback to a default state of our application in case of an error (this fallback can be a 404 page which is normally not that graceful but is better than a page to just stop working).

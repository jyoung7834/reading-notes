## Installed Node.js and Heroku

### Node.js For Beginners.  Deploy Your Blog to Heroku

Node.js is an open source, cross-lplatform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side networking applications.  It's written in JavaScript and can be run with in the Node.js runtime on any platform.  

Tiny server.js

`var http = require("http");`

`http.createServer(function(request, response) {`
  `response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});`
  `response.write("It's alive!");`
  `response.end();`
`}).listen(3000);`

Run your terminal:
`node server.js`

This code performs a request for some resource.  When the response comes back, an anonymous function is called. 

`$.post('/some_requested_resource', function(data) {`
  `console.log(data);`
`});`

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service.  It allows you to deploy your web server.

1) heroku login
2)  Create your project directory.  And then create the server.js file inside of it. 
First declare some variables. 
    
    `var http = require("http");` = The first one will give you the key to Node's HTTP functionality.

    `var fs = require("fs");` = The second one is for possibility to interact with the file system.

    `var path = require("path");` = The third one allows you to handle file paths.

    `var mime = require("mime");` = The third one allows you to handle file paths.

It's not a part of Node.js, so we need to install third-party dependencies before using it. We need to create the package.json file for that purpose. 

`{`
  `"name" : "blog",`

  `"version" : "0.0.1",`

  `"description" : "My minimalistic blog",`

  `"dependencies" : {`

    `"mime" : "~1.2.7"`

  `}`
`}`

## Flexbox

Flexbos is a whole modue and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties.  Some meant to be set on the container or the child.

- Container = Parent element
  - Children = items

Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from main-start to main-end) or the cross axis (from cross-start to cross-end)

- main axix =  The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction property
- main-start | main-end = The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.
- main size = A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.
- cross axis = The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.
- cross-start \ cross-end = Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.
- cross size = The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.

  ## ** Chapter 1: Structure (pp 12-39) **
   These pages discussed understanding structure, how pages use structure, structuring word documents and how HTML describes the structure of pages using elements.  Most all elements have an opening tag and a closing tags which act as containers telling you something about the information that is between ther opening and closing tags.  Tags were discussed as well as how attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. The main tags of body, head and title were explained and the order in which they are placed. 
  
   Summary structture - HTML pages are text documents.  HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surroun d special meaning.  Tags are often referred to as elements.  Tags usually come in pars.  The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.  Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.  Attributes require a name and a value.  To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go. 

  ## ** Chapter 8: Extra Markup (p 176-199) **
   This chapter covered Specifying different versions of HTML, Identifying and grouping elements, and Comments, meta information and iframes.  There was discussion on doctypes, comments in HTML, ID attributes, class attributes, block elements, and inline elements.  Grouping text & elements ina block and grouping text & elements inline was discussed. Information on iFrames and meta tags were describe and how these elements are used.  Escape characters were discussed. 

  Summary Extra Markup - DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.  You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.  The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.  The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.  <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.  The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your we page.  Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <,> and the copyright symbol. 


  ## ** Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout (pp 428-451) **
  This chapter coverd HTML5 layout elements, how old browsers understand new elements and Styling HTML5 layout elements with CSS.  

  Summary HTML5 Layout.  The new HTML 5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.  The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements)  Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.  To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google. 

  ## ** Chapter 18:Process & Design (p452-475) **
 
  This chapter covered How to approach building a site, Understanding your audience and their needs, and How to present information visitors want to see.  

  Summary Process & Design.  It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.  Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.  Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.  Design is about communication.  Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.  You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.  You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

# RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN and FLOATS

## Shay How's intro to RWD (responsive web design)


### Responsive Overview
Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.

### Flexible Layouts
Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. The first part, flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.

`target/content = result`
`margin: 1.858736059%; /*  10px รท 538px = .018587361 */`

### Media Queries
Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles.

*Initializing Media Queries*

`@media all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}`

`@import url(styles.css) all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}`

Common media types include all, screen, print, tv, and braille. The HTML5 specification includes new media types, even including 3d-glasses.

*Logical Operators in Media Queries*

`@media all and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px) {...}`

`@media all and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px) {...}`

`@media all and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px) {...}`

*Omitting a Media Type*

# Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing - state and mutable data 

Pure functions 

  * returns the same result if given the sam e arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
  * does not cause any observable side effects. 

## Reading files

If a function reads external files, it's not a pure function - the file's contents can change. 

## Random number generator

Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure. 

Pure functions are stable, consistent , and predictable.  

Pure function benefits 

* Easy to test
* Mocking not necessary

## Immutability

Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. 

*Recursion* 
  * With recursion, we keep our variable immutable.  The list and the accumulator variables are not changed.  It keeps the same value.  

  Use *reduce* to implement this function

##  Slugify

`const string = "I will be a url slug ";`

`const slugify = string =>`
  `string`
    `.toLowerCase()`
    `.trim()`
    `.split(' ")`
    `.join("-");`

slugify(string); //i-will-be-a-url-slug

* toLowerCase:  Converts the string to all lower case
* trim:  removes whitespace from both ends of a string
* split and join: replaces all instances of match with replacement in a given string

We combine all these 4 functions and we can "slugify" our string.

## Referential transparency

square function

const square = (n) => n * n;

square(2); //4

referentially transparent.  It will always return 4

If a function consistently yidlds the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent. 

pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

###Functions as First-Class entities
* refer to it from constants and variables
* pass it as a parameter to other functions
* return it as result from other functions

const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
const subtraction = (a, b) => a - b;
const doubleOperator = (f, a, b) => f(a, b) * 2

doubleOperator(sum, 3, 1); // 8

doubleOperator (subtraction, 3, 1); //4

## Higher order functions
* takes one or more functions as arguments, or 
* returns a function as its result

## Filter
* Create an empty array evenNumbers
* iterate over the numbers array
* pushthe numbers to the evenNumbers array

const even = n => n % 2 == 0;
const listOfNumbers = [, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
listOfNumbers.filter(even); //[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


## Map 

## Reduce

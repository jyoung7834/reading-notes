## Chapter 11 - Color
- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions. 
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:  RGB values, hex codes, and color names. 
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity.  It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacit value.  It is know as HSLA. 

## Chapter 12 - Text
- There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing. 
- There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed. 
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them. 
- You can use speudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.

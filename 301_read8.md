# Structured Query Language- SQL

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

## Relational databases

A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

SELECT queries
* SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries.
* Query

  * Is a statement
  * declares what data is being searched
  * where to find data
  * how to transform it before it is returned

  Each rowe in a table has an instance - This means that the columns would then represent the common properties shared by all instances of that entity 

Select query for a specific columns

  `SELECT column, another_column, ...`

  `FROM  mytable;`'

Select query for all columns

`SELECT *`

`FROM mytable;`

Queries with constraints

`SELECT column, another_column, ...`

`FROM mytable`

`WHERE *CONDITION*`

    `AND/OR another_condition`

    `AND/OR ...;`

More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous AND or OR logical keywords (ie. num_wheels >= 4 AND doors <= 2). And below are some useful operators that you can use for numerical data (ie. integer or floating point):
Operator|     Condition	       |SQL Example

=, !=, < <=, >, >=	|Standard numerical operators|	col_name != 4

BETWEEN … AND …	|Number is within range of two values (inclusive)|	col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5

NOT BETWEEN … AND …	|Number is not within range of two values (inclusive)|	col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10

IN (…)	|Number exists in a list|	col_name IN (2, 4, 6)

NOT IN (…)	|Number does not exist in a list|	col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5)

exp. Find the movies not released in the years between 2000 and 2010

`SELECT title, year FROM movies`

`WHERE year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010;`

### Queries with constraints

### Filtering and Sorting Query results

Select query with ordered results

`SELECT column, another_column, …`

`FROM mytable`

`WHERE condition(s)`

`ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;`

# The ABC of Programming
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.  Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.  Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.  To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help)

# How do computers fit in with the world around them? 
- This chapter discussed how a brower sees a web page.  Computers create models of the world using data.  The models use objects to repressent physical things.  Objects can have: properties that tell us about the object; methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object; events which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer.  Programmers can werrite code to say "When this event occurs, run that code."  Web browers use HTML markup to create a model of the web page.  Each element creates its own node (which is a kind of object).  To make web pages interactive, you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page. 

# How do I write a script for a web page? 
- How to use objects & methods was discussed.  It describe how javascript runs where it is found in the HTML.  Summary - The ABC of Programming.  It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file.  JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extension.  The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).  If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser had created.

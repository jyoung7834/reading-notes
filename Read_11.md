# AJAX & JSON
Ajax is a technique for loading data into part of a page without having to refresh the entire page.  The data is often sent in a format called JavaScript

* Ajax refers to a group of technologies that allow you to update just one part of the page (rather than reload a whole page).

* You can incorporate HTML, XML, or JSON data into your pages. (JSON is becoming increasingly popular.)

* To load JSON from a different domain, you can use JSONP but only if the code is from a trusted source. 

* JQuery has methods that make it easier to use AJax.

* .load() is the simplest way to load HTML into your pages and allow you to update just a part of the pages. 

* .ajax() is more powerful and more complex.  (Several shorthand methods are also offered.)

*  It is important to consider how the site will work if the user does not have JavaScript enabled, or if the page is not able to access the data from a server.

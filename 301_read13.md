# Sending form data

## Client/server Architecture

A client sends a request to a server  using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

An HTML form on a web page is a way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.

**How to send data on the client side**

The `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are *action* and *method*.

**The Action Attribute**

The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form — the current page.

In this example, the data is sent to an absolute URL — https://example.com:

`<form action="https://example.com">`
Here, we use a relative URL — the data is sent to a different URL on the same origin:

`<form action="/somewhere_else">`
When specified with no attributes, as below, the `<form>` data is sent to the same page that the form is present on:

`<form>`

**The method attribute**
The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the *GET* method and the *POST* method

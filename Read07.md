# Functions, Methods & Objects

* Functions allow you to group a set of related     statements together that represent a single task.
* Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value. 
* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date.  Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other. 


Creating an object: Constructor Notation - The new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object.  You can then add properties and mehtods to the object. 

Updating an object - To update the value of properties, us dot notation or square brackets.  The work on objects created using literal or constructor notation.  To delete a property, use the delete keyword. 

Creating Many objects:  Constructor Notation - Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things.  Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.  First, create the template with the object's properties and methods. 

You create instances of the object using the constructor function.  The new keyword followed by a call to the function creates a new object.  The properties of each object are given as arguments to the function.

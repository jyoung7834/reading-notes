## jQuery 

jQuery is a JavaScript file that you include in your web pages.  It lets you find elements using CSS-style selectors and then do something with the elements using jQuery methods. 

1. Find elements using CSS-Style Selectors

Function (creates jquery object)
`$('li.hot')`

The jQuery() function has one parameter:  a CSS-style selector.  This selector finds all of the `<li>` elements with a class of hot. 


2. Do something with the elements using jQuery Methods

jQuery object = `$('li.hot')'
Member Operator = .
Method = `addClass('complete');`

`$('li.hot').addClass('complete');`

### Basic jQuery

1) In order to use jQuery, the first thing you need to do is include the jQuery script in your page.  You can included before the closing `</body>`.

2)  Once jWuery has been added to the page, a second JavaScript file is included that uses jQuery selectors and methods to update the content of the HTML page. 

`$()` shortcut for the jQuery ().

jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript.  It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler. 

jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more,"  because it allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code that you would need to write with plain JavaScript. 

When you select one or more elements, a jQuery object is returned.  It is also known as a matched set or a jquery selection. 

Implicit iteration = The abilit to update all of the elements in the jQuery selection.

If you want to use more thatn one jQuery method on the same selection of elements, you can list several methods at a time using dot notation to separate each one. 

Chaining = The process of placing several methods in the same selector. 

To make your code easier to read, you can place each new method on a new line: 

$('li[id!='one']')

.hide()

.delay(500)

.fadeIn(1400);

jQuery's .ready() method checks that the page is ready for your code to work with.

$(document) creates a jQuery object representing the page.

When teh page is ready, the function inside the parentheses of the .ready() method is run.

$(document).ready(function) {
  // your script goes here
});

Getting Element Content
.html()

$('ul').html() = will select all lis in the ul

$('li').html will select everything in the first li including the tags residing inside. 

.tex() retrieves the just the text.
